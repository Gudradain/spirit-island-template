        Each {presence} on this ability represents 1 Time. Many of your Powers require Time as an additional cost. Spend it when you <strong>Resolve</strong> the Power. <em>(Not when you play it.)</em>
		
		When you <strong>Gain 1 Time</strong>, put 1 of your {presence} here from your {presence} track (or, optionally, the island). When you <strong>Spend 1 Time</strong>, return it to a {presence} track - or if you have no free spaces, Destroy it.

        Your 3rd Growth option lets you gain any one Power Card from a special set you create during Setup. When you gain a Power Card any other way, you may add one unchosen card to this set.

		<!-- GROWTH  
			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);
			Gaining Elements: gain-element(water,fire); gain-element(water,2);
			Adding Presence: add-presence(1); add-presence(1,jungle); add-presence(2,town,city,blight,or); add-presence(2,strife,city,and);
			
			Sub-Groups of Growth are possible (think Lure)
			Example: <sub-growth title="pick one of:" bordered>   here 'bordered' creates the double line border
