        When you would Forget a Power Card from your hand, you may instead discard it. (Max. once per Action.)

      <special-rule>
        Some of your Actions let you <strong>Prepare</strong> Element Markers, which are kept here until used. Choose the Elements freely. <em>(I.e., you are not limited to Elements you have at the time.)</em>
<br>
Each Element Marker spent grants 1 of that Element for a single Action. <em>(E.g., one Power use.)</em>

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);
			Gaining Elements: gain-element(water,fire); gain-element(water,2);
			Adding Presence: add-presence(1); add-presence(1,jungle); add-presence(2,town,city,blight,or); add-presence(2,strife,city,and);
			
			Sub-Groups of Growth are possible (think Lure)
			Example: <sub-growth title="pick one of:" bordered>   here 'bordered' creates the double line border
