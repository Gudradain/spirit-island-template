Designer's Comments: 
When the Dahan first came to the island, some stumbled sideways onto paths that led to Shimmering Traces of Madness and were consumed. The other spirits warned the Dahan away from the doors which open onto its realm so, for centuries, it has been quiescent. Now, the newcomers do not know what to avoid and where not to go.
Madness waits in its dark dimension, a realm utterly unlike the island. The gap between dimensions is wide, but its influence on the island is slowly growing. As invaders catch small glimpses of its alien world, it draws closer still. The other spirits aren't sure what will become of Madness once the invaders are driven off the island, but desparate times demand strange allies.
Play Style: Drive invaders mad, applying the effect of leftover Fear cards.
