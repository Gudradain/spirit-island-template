            Shimmering Traces of Madness
        </spirit-name>
        <lore-description>
		When the Dahan first came to the island, some stumbled sideways onto the ways of Madness. The other spirits warned the Dahan away from the doors which open onto its realm so, for centuries, it has been quiescent. Now, the newcomers do not know what to avoid and where not to go.
		<br /><br />
		Madness waits in its dark dimension, a realm utterly unlike the island. The gap between dimensions is wide, but its influence on the island is slowly growing. As invaders catch small glimpses of its alien world, it draws closer still. The other spirits aren't sure what will become of Madness once the invaders are driven off the island, but desparate times demand strange allies.

Put 2 {presence} on your starting board in the highest-numbered land
with no Invaders or {Dahan}. Take the Fear cards that were not used to set up
the fear deck and shuffle them to form the Madness deck.

The Portal of Madness innate power is unpredictable but potentially very powerful.
Having {sacred-site} on many boards makes the effects stronger, but setting that up requires your weakest Growth option.
<br /><br />
Can place Strife to keep Invaders from running amok in the meantime, but more Strife comes at the cost of Fear.
