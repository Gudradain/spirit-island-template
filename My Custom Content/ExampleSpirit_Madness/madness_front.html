		The Madness deck is made from the Fear cards not used in setting up the Fear deck. Resolved cards from the Madness deck are placed in the Fear Discard.
		If the Madness deck is emptied, shuffle all resolved Fear cards together to make a new Madness deck.      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>The Mad Fear Nothing</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
		When one of your powers would do 2 or more {fear} in a land, you may add {strife}.
		Reduce the amount of {fear} by 2 for each {strife} you add. (Fear for destroying {town}/{city} does not count.)

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);
