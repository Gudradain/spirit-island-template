      <special-rule>
        Whenever an invader or {dahan} is destroyed in your land, you can place them on your spirit board. During the
        spirit phase, you may discard 2 health worth of invaders or {dahan} on your spirit board to place a {skeleton}
        in one of your lands.
        <br><br>
        You may only have as many {skeleton} as you have revealed {moon} on your presence tracks. If you would place a
        skeleton on the board that would push you above your limit, you must then sacrifice a skeleton.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Mindless Rage</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        During ravage, {skeleton} in lands without your {presence} count as {badland}.
