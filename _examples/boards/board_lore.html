            Shifting Memory of Ages
        </spirit-name>
        <lore-description>
            An immensley old Spirit that has ascended to great power countless times over teh ages - and then destroyed that power each time, severing huge pieces of itself to become small once again.
            It does this in part for the joy of learning anew, but also for the delight of perceiving the living world on the short timescales that larger Spirits grow beyond.
            <br><br>
            The Invaders' arrival has pushed it to grow much more quickly than it usually would, re-learning lessons and powers from its deep past in order to fight more effectively.
            After the fight is won, there will be time to forget, to diminish, and renew itself once more.

                    Put 2 {presence} on your starting board in the highest-numbered land that is Sands or Mountain. Get out the Elemental Markers. 
                    Prepare 1 {moon}, 1 {air}, and 1 {earth} marker (put them by your Special Rules).

                    Starts with little ability to influcne the board - most of what it does in that regard will come from new Power Cards.
                    <br><br>
                    Extremely good with Major Powers and usually wants to take them early and often. 
                    Can either try sprinting towards victory with its phenomenal Energy Growth or build up towards becoming a late-game powerhouse.
