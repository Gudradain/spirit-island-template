      <special-rule>
        Whenever you push any number of {presence} from a land, you must push them all to the same land. If that land
        had element tokens on it, those tokens moves with the {presence}.
        </special-rules-subtitle>
        <br><br>
        Whenever an action changes the number of {presence} in one of your lands, for each neighbouring land with a number
        of presence that is now no longer coprime to the original land, you must push all {presence} from that land to
        another land. If
        you would be forced to push presence from another land as a result of one of these pushes, you must instead
        return presence to your track until you no longer would have to push.
        <br><br>
        When you add {presence}, you may not move an existing presence on the board. You must add it from your track.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Perfection is Power</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        When you uncover a {star} in your presence track, you choose an element token to place there. You cannot choose
        an element token that you have already placed on your presence track. If you return presence to that track spot,
        remove the element token placed.
        <br><br>
        When you return a {presence} to you presence track, you main return it to anywhere on the track, but when you
        add {presence} from the track, you must always add from the left-most {presence} on the track.
        <br><br>
        Whenever you add your {presence} to a land from your track, you may add an element marker to that land. If the
        land has no presence, you cannot have presence tokens on it. If the land has 1 to 4 {presence}, it can hav up to
        1 element token. If the land has 5 or more {presence}, it can have 2 element tokens on it. If you ever have too
        many tokens in a single land, you must remove tokens until you are at the limit.
        <br><br>
        During the growth phase, for each {star} you have on your element tracks, you gain 1 of that type of element for
        each land you have with a number of {presence} greater of equal to the energy counter on that growth track slot,
        and the same element token on the land as on the {star}. You gain 2 of each element type instead for each match
        if the energy counter on the growth track option is 5 or greater.
      </special-rule>

      <special-rule>
        You may not gain major power cards. At the beginning of the game, take the top two major powers and set them
        aside beside your spirit card. If they do not target a land, keep drawing and replacing until you find two that
        do.
        <br><br>
        When you grow along your card play track, instead of card plays, you unlock Major Power Slots. For each slot
        unlocked, you get -1 energy gain <i>(min 0)</i>.
        <br><br>
        Both of your innate powers have conditions to use a major power slot. When you use a power slot, you may play
        one of your major powers set aside by payings its cost, target the same land as the innate power ignoring
        targeting restrictions. At the end of the turn, you must forget that card. Then look at the top 4 cards of the
        major power deck, replacing any non-land targets powers, pick 1 and set it aside for future use.
        <br><br>
        For each use of this, you must have the approriate number of slots unlocked on your growth track.
