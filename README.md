- [Icons](_docs/icon.md)

### Getting Started

1. Download the ZIP file (on GitHub.com, Code > Download ZIP) and extract it on your computer.
2. Open the folder "spirit-island-template-master". You should see folders such as "_docs", "_examples", "_global", and "My Custom Content". 
3. Open the 'My Custom Content' folder and then open the folder for spirits, adversary, etc.
4. Open the examples in a browser to view the stylized content. Open the examples in a text editor to modify.
     **NOTE:** The folder depth is important. You can create new folders but the .html files must be at the same folder depth (ie. 2 deeper than the root folder).
5. You can copy the examples again from the "_examples" folder.

### Tips for Maintenance

1. Cloning the project with GIT instead of downloading it as a ZIP file make it easier to receive updates later on.
2. Don't modify the files in the folder "_docs", "_examples" and "_global". Your modifications might be lost when you get the latest version of the project. Instead, create new folders for your creations.
