This project uses 3 fonts:

- JosefinSans-Regular: This font is bundled in the project and use the Open Font License.
- Gobold Extra2: You can download this font [here](https://www.dafont.com/fr/gobold.font).
- DK Snemand (demo): You can download this font [here](https://www.dafont.com/dk-snemand.font).

Note: Due to licensing, I did not include some of the fonts in the project.

### Getting Started

1. Download the ZIP file and extract it on your computer.
2. Navigate to the "_examples/card" folder then open "cards.html" in your browser.
3. Open "cards.html" in your favorite text editor and create your cards.

### Tips for Maintenance

1. Cloning the project with GIT instead of downloading it as a ZIP file make it easier to receive updates later on.
2. Don't modify the files in the folder "_docs", "_examples" and "_global". Your modifications might be lost when you get the latest version of the project. Instead, create new folder for your creations.

The fonts use their own license.
