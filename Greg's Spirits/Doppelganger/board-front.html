      <special-rule>
        Whenever you gain a power card, instead of keeping it, you must give it to another spirit. You have no cards of your own. If you choose to gain a major power, the spirit you give it to must forget a power card to receive it.
        <br><br>
        Your Copycat power may not be repeated in any way.
        <br><br>
        When you take presence off your presence track, you may take it off of anywhere.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Reshape One's Image</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        At the beginning of each spirit phase, you may copy target {spirit}'s Special Rules and use them in addition to your own. You cannot choose the same spirit 2 turns in a row unless there is no other choice.
