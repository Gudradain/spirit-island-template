      <special-rule>
        Whenever you gain a power card, instead of keeping it, you must give it to another spirit. You have no cards of your own. If you choose to gain a major power, the spirit you give it to must forget a power card to receive it.
        <br><br>
        Your Copycat power may not be repeated in any way.

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);

			Adding Presence: add-presence(1); add-presence(1,jungle); add-presence(2,town,city,blight,or); add-presence(2,strife,city,and);
			
			Sub-Groups of Growth are possible (think Lure)

Each time you copy a power, you must copy from a spirit you have not yet copied a power from yet if possible.
