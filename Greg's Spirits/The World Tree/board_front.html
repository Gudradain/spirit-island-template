        All lands with your {sacred-site} are considered to be part of the World Tree. Any power that targets a land that is part of the World Tree is copied and targets all lands that are part of the World Tree, regardless of targeting restrictions. You may move any tokens or invaders (not {presence}) between World Tree lands at any time. Any land adjacent to any World Tree land is considered adjacent to all of them.
        <br><br>
        If invaders would perform an invader action in a World Tree land, they do it in every World Tree land.

      <special-rule>
        All power cards you play that target a land have {range-0} and cost 1 less energy to play if they are a minor power, and 2 less energy to play if they are a major power (min 0). The range modifier can be modified by other abilities.

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);
			Gaining Elements: gain-element(water,fire); gain-element(water,2);
			Adding Presence: add-presence(1); add-presence(1,jungle); add-presence(2,town,city,blight,or); add-presence(2,strife,city,and);
			
			Sub-Groups of Growth are possible (think Lure)
			Example: <sub-growth title="pick one of:" bordered>   here 'bordered' creates the double line border
